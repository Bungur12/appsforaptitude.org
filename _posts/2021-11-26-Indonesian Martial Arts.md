Martial arts is a sport that is used to defend and defend oneself against threats that come from outside or other people. Understanding self-defense in general is the use of various methods carried out by humans with the aim of defending themselves from enemy attacks. This is important if you are facing a dangerous situation, such as robbery, mugging, bullying or other negative things that threaten your safety.

Martial arts is a sport that is quite popular in the world. There are many types of martial arts originating from various countries. But did you know that Indonesia also has martial arts? Not only pencak silat, but there are still many self-defense sports that are characteristic in various regions in Indonesia. The following is a review of martial arts originating from Indonesia which was reported from various sources:

**1. Pencak Silat**

Pencak Silat is the most popular type of martial arts from Indonesia. This martial art originates from the culture of the Malay tribe and was founded in 1550. Pencak Silat is well known for its attacks using strength and agility techniques as well as the power of body intelligence.

Pencak Silat is a martial art that is also used in national defense training. This martial art is feared by other countries because it is famous for its inner strength which is often shown in immune attractions. Therefore, pencak silat is also often used in the education system of the police and Kopassus or TNI.

Not only in the country, but Pencak Silat already exists in other countries, you know. The official organization of the International Pencak Silat Alliance (PERSILAT) noted that there were already 33 pencak silat organizations spread all over the world. Pencak silat is also an official sport that is competed in the SEA Games. Now, PERSILAT is promoting pencak silat to several countries on five continents with the hope of making pencak silat a sport in the Olympics.

**2. Silek Minangkabau**

This martial sport originated from Minangkabau. The Minangkabau community, West Sumatra, is known for the habit of wandering since hundreds of years ago. For this reason, they must also have the ability to defend themselves in case of unwanted things while wandering. That's where Silek Minangkabau was born.

The word silek is a combat art movement that is used to defend oneself from enemy attacks, so that movements are attempted as little as possible, quickly, precisely, with the intention of paralyzing the opponent.

This type of martial arts has been passed down from generation to generation. Silek Minangkabau for Minang people is an identity that is inherent in their daily lives. Because of its nature for self-defense, there is a rule in silek not to attack dangerous parts of the opponent's body. This martial sport also implies that those who master silek well must have high patience because learning this martial art is not easy.

**3. Bakti Negara**

In Bali there is a school of pencak silat called Bakti Negara. Bakti Negara is a self-defense sport that is guided by the teachings of the Balinese Hindu Dharma, namely Tri Hita Karana. This martial sport was born on January 31, 1955 due to the arrival of the Dutch colonialists at that time who wanted to rule. Bakti Negara was founded in Banjar Kaliungu Kaja, Denpasar, Bali.

It was initiated and founded by four former Indonesian freedom fighters, namely Anak Agung Rai Tokir, I Bagus Made Rai Keplag, Anak Agung Meranggi, Sri Empu Dwi Tantra, and Ida Bagus Oka Dewangkara. Before being named Bakti Negara, this martial art had various names in Indonesia before 1948.

In Bali, for example, Balinese elders call Tengklung. While in Central Java it is called Pencak, in West Java it is called Mainpo, and in Sumatra it is called Silek. During the colonial period, self-defense was taught as a camouflage in the form of art, because the Dutch were aware that pencak silat could foster a sense of nationalism that could oppose and threaten the existence of the Dutch.

**4. Tarung Derajat**

Just like pencak silat, Tarung Derajat is also a self-defense sport from Indonesia which has been officially competed in the SEA Games since 2013.

This martial art emphasizes aggressive attacks in hitting and kicking, as well as various slamming, locking and sweeping techniques. This martial arts has now also become a sport at the 2013 Sea Games.

**5. Merpati Putih**
