Now after doing a basic warm-up, now you can get into the types of sports without tools that can be done at home, in the office or in the park. So that you don't get bored, here are some types of cardio exercises without equipment that you can try:

**Jump**
Jumping excuses is a pretty effective way to get sweaty without having to run around jogging tracks in normally crowded city parks. Replace the classic jump rope move with a cross jack, which requires you to alternate between your legs and arms as you jump. Here's the guide:

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and spread your arms out to your sides with your palms facing down. Throw your body up while crossing your right hand over your left hand and your right foot in front of your left leg. Jump to return to the starting position. Then, jump again with opposite arms and legs (left hand crossed over right hand and left leg crossed in front of right foot). This move counts as 1 set.

For best results, alternate sides and repeat 25 sets. The thing you should pay attention to is to keep your jump speed and if possible don't rest too long between jumps.

If you feel this movement is too heavy, there are other alternatives you know! Try small jumps (no need to be taller than 5 cm) by keeping your toes on and pushing yourself up with the heels of your feet as if you were jumping rope.

**Circle hop squats**
Circle hop squats can be an option for exercising at home without equipment. Or it could be an option for those of you who want to stay in shape even though you are busy at the office because you can also do this exercise at the office. So for those who don't know, here's the right guide for doing the circle hop squat!

Stand with your feet spread apart with your fingers slightly out of the way. Then puff out your chest and lower your upper body into a squat, touching the ground with your arms outstretched.

Then press the body down to prepare to jump up, turning left 180 degrees while in the air; at the same time, swing both hands over the body from right to left. Then, land slowly in a squat position, both hands back straight supported on the ground

Repeat the jump by changing the position of the arm swing (now from left to right). Continue to do squats alternating sides, 2-3 sets of 10 reps per set.

**Mountain climber twist**
The next movement you can do for cardio without equipment is the mountain climber twist. This exercise itself is one type of variation of the plank which is known to be very effective for burning stubborn fat in the body. You can do this exercise anywhere because the Mountain climber twist does not require any tools. Check out the moves below:

Start in a high plank position, which means your legs are stretched out straight on the ground with your hands resting on the ground, also stretched out straight while tightening your abs. Then, bend the knee of the leg and cross it to the right in the body towards the right elbow, with the position of the foot as if you were running. Next, switch positions by crossing your right knee towards the left in your body.

Do alternating as quickly as possible without lifting your hips, for seconds. Now for those of you who feel that this movement is difficult to do, try to change the cross knee movement by "running" the knee forward towards the chest.

**Jumping lunges**

The last cardio exercise at home without equipment that you can try is Jumping lunges. Besides being recommended for burning fat, the following exercises are also good for regulating your breathing. Follow the method below, yes!

Begin the movement with your chest and chin raised and your stomach muscles tightened. Take a big step forward with your right foot. Then sink your upper body straight down so that your right knee is snugly above the shoe and your left knee is "floating" in the air facing the floor. Continue with each knee bent at 90 degrees.

The next move is to jump. Change the foot on the middle of the jump so that you land with your left foot in front of your right foot and immediately sink your lower body back into the starting lunge position. Keep doing it for seconds.
