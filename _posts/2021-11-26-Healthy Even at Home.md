Due to the seriousness of the Corona pandemic situation, it's likely that you stay at home.

Indeed, staying at home is much safer, and it has also become an appeal from the government to practice social distancing.

But just staying at home causes you to be less physically active too.

Just imagine: I used to walk up the stairs or cross the road, now I work to keep my job in bed while eating a snack.

No wonder the scale needle has shifted slightly to the right!

But you don't need to worry, Friend Superjuangan, because this article will discuss types of light exercise that are suitable to do at home!

Don't worry, beginners can do it too. The original intention to be healthy!

Why should you exercise?

In addition to maintaining weight, exercise is very important for other aspects of health, you know!

If you want to keep your weight, check your BMI first! Let's also read how to calculate ideal body weight.

For example, cardio exercise trains the heart and lung muscles which makes you fitter and prevents heart or lung disease. Usually cardio exercise also makes you mentally healthier. A study from the European Journal of Sport Science said 15 minutes of cardio exercise for 2-3 times a week can overcome anxiety disorders and depression.

On the other hand, cardio exercise must also be complemented by strength training for the sake of muscle building. According to My Active SG, this muscle building can accelerate your metabolic rate and balance the composition of muscle and fat in your body. This means that not only are you losing weight, but you are making your own body burn more fat so it is easier for you to lose weight.

For those of you who are just trying, there's no need to try the extreme. The important thing is that you do physical activity for 30 minutes per day with a frequency of 5 days per week. If you can't, remember that even 10 or 5 minutes is better than nothing!

Is it okay to exercise during the Corona pandemic?

In fact, exercise is very necessary. By maintaining physical health and fitness, you are also building a stronger immune system to fight the ongoing Corona pandemic.

But keep in mind that you also have to take preventive steps, such as exercising around the house, wearing a mask, keeping a distance from other people, lowering the clothes you wear after going out, and washing your hands immediately after going out.

What types of exercise can you do at home?

Here Super You Team has summarized 5 types of light and simple exercise that can be done at home for those of you who want to try to start a healthy life:

No need to bother. You just walk around the housing at a speed of about 5 km / hour. Actually this sport is a type of cardio, so the goal is to build physical endurance (endurance), because it is ideally done within a period of 30 minutes per day.

But if you are not used to it, you can start with 10 minutes per day first for the first week, then increase it to 15 minutes per day, then 20 minutes per day. Keep increasing it until you reach 30 minutes per day.

Well, this one sport includes training the muscles in the core and lower body. Squat being one of the classic types of exercise, is also easy to do. Based on the Nerd Fitness guide, you can setup it by:

* Stand with your feet slightly apart than your hips.
* Toes point slightly outward, about 5-20 degrees.
* Look straight ahead and focus on a single point on the wall in front of you.
* Focus on that point during the squat, don't look at the floor or the roof.

Here's the correct posture for the squat:

Make sure your posture is correct, Friend Superjuang!

Ideally squats are done regularly. The frequency itself can be adjusted according to your ability. If you are new, you can start with 10 times in 1 set and 3 times a week. Little by little, you can start increasing the frequency to 15 times per set, then 20 times.

Push ups are also one of the classic types of exercise. This is because push ups are one of the simplest muscle exercises in the upper body.

However, keep in mind that push ups must be done correctly to be effective. For those of you who are still beginners, you can try practicing with incline push-ups first.

Incline push ups are a variation of push ups where the support for push ups is not on the floor but on a higher plane than your feet, such as a table, chair, or even a wall. Here's how to incline push-ups based on Runtastic:

* Find a high area (stairs, table, or wall) where you can do incline push ups in a straight line.
* Start by trying as many reps as you can in a good position, rest for 2 minutes, and repeat for 2 sets. Do it 3 times per week.
* Do it until you can do 3 x 10 (3 sets, 10 reps each) in a good position â€“ good position means an upright body, especially in the chest, stomach, buttocks, and elbows.
* Continue to try at a lower altitude and repeat the process. Keep decreasing the height until you finally reach the floor.

Similar to walking, cycling is also a cardio exercise.

But compared to walking, cycling is a type of exercise that is more effective for reducing weight. According to research based on Better Health, cycling burns 300 calories per hour.

Therefore the ideal cycling takes a lot of time, which is 30 minutes per day (for exercise every day) to 60 minutes per day (for training 2-3 times a week).

Like other sports, cycling can be done gradually. As a beginner, you don't have to be able to do minutes per day. You can try with 10 minutes walking around the complex only when you have time (eg 2 times a week). Then increase the duration (to 15 minutes) or the frequency of exercise (to 3 times a week).

Keep practicing until you get used to reaching 60 minutes per day.

Did you know that jumping rope is an effective cardio exercise?

According to research, jumping rope for 10 minutes is equivalent to jogging for 30 minutes. Therefore, jumping rope does not need to be done for a long time such as cycling or walking, but must be done properly.

Here's how to do the right jump rope for beginners according to Cross Rope:

* Make sure both feet are tightly closed when jumping.
* Jump on the center of the foot and land slowly.
* Make sure you don't jump too high.
* Make sure your knees are slightly bent.
* Keep the spine high and neutral.
* Keep your chest and head straight and make sure your head is looking straight ahead.
* Pull shoulders back and elbows down.
* Put your hands along the middle of the body (according to the rope).
* Use your wrist to twist the strap (not your shoulder or elbow).

However, Friends of the Super Fight must remember that sport is not a matter of showing off skills or appearance, but a matter of health. Therefore, don't get too hung up on your performance as long as it's healthy. Exercise doesn't have to be crazy, it can be small as long as it is carried out regularly. I hope this article helps you to stay healthy.
