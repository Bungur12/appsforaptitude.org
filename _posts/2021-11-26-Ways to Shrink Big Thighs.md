Having large calves, thighs, and buttocks sometimes makes some people insecure. Small thighs and calves are considered as an indicator of an ideal body shape. This beauty standard makes many people, both women and men, who are looking for various ways to reduce their thighs and calves. In fact, shrink the thighs, calves, and buttocks can not be done instantly. How to shrink calves and thighs? Is there a powerful exercise to reduce thighs?

Factors that affect the size of the thigh
There are many things that can affect the size of your thighs. One of the main factors is genetics. There is a gene called KLF14 which is believed to have an important role in the distribution of fat in female body parts.

Differences in gene variants are thought to be able to determine the shape of a woman's body. For example, a pear-like body shape that is identical to a larger thigh size and a slimmer upper body. Well, besides heredity, there are other things that might contribute to the size of your thighs.

1. Gender
It is a characteristic of women that the size of the pelvis, buttocks, and thighs are larger than men. How come? Women and men do have a different distribution of body fat. The hormone estrogen produced by the female body makes the accumulation of fat more in the hips, buttocks, and thighs. While the accumulation of fat in the male body tends to be more in the front abdominal area.

2. Diet high in fat and sugar
Food has a big effect on the accumulation of fat in the body. Moreover, foods are high in saturated and trans fats, sugar, and salt. Most of the consumption of these types of foods will make you gain weight and increase body fat composition.

The fat will later run to the thighs. If the weight gain is too large, the risk of obesity will be higher.

3. Sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise
Eating too many high-fat foods plus infrequent exercise can cause more fat accumulation in the thighs. Basically, physical activity is beneficial for burning fat. Not only sports, household activities such as sweeping, washing clothes, and cleaning a room that takes energy and sweat can also help.

**How to shrink and tighten thighs, calves, and buttocks**

As explained above, an inactive lifestyle and a high-carbohydrate diet will make fat accumulate in the body. Meanwhile, the distribution of body fat composition is regulated by a gene that certainly cannot be changed.

Therefore, how to shrink the thighs and hips by means of physical exercise and diet can be in vain. The combination of the two is not always effective in reducing fat where you want it.

However, physical exercise and diet can help burn body fat, help tone the muscles of the body, including the thighs, and make your body healthier and avoid the risk of chronic disease.

1. Improve diet
Adopting a healthy diet is one of the best ways to maintain body fat composition. Expand the consumption of complex carbohydrates that come from whole wheat bread, various green and orange vegetables, and fruits. The fiber contained in these types of foods will make you full longer, thereby reducing the portion of food.

In addition to carbohydrates, consuming lean protein sources can also help reduce fat accumulation by building muscle. You can get protein intake from fatty fish, skinless chicken breast, egg whites, low-fat milk and processed products.

Do not forget to drink lots of water, about 8 glasses a day. Drink water before every meal. That way, you are fuller and eat less. Drinking lots of water will also meet the body's fluid needs and prevent dehydration.

Also limit foods high in saturated and trans fats, and sugars such as fried foods, cakes, ice cream, and milk chocolate. Reduce the use of salt and consumption of salty foods such as potato chips and snacks.

"If what makes thighs big is fat, how to reduce fat that accumulates is the same as reducing fat in other body parts, namely by diet and exercise. Start eating with smaller portions, low-fat protein, lots of vegetables and fruit,” said dr. Irma Lidia, Jovee's team of doctors.

He also explained that in the past, fat in the lower body area was considered not associated with the risk of heart disease and diabetes. "However, more recent research has shown that reduced fat in the lower body area is associated with better heart health." he continued.

2. Sports and physical exercise
Certain physical exercises can be done to help tone the thigh muscles. Tight thigh muscles will make the thigh shape more proportional and look slimmer.
